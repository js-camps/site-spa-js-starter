# Storybook

## Set up Storybook

1. **Install Storybook**: First, you need to install the necessary Storybook packages. You can do this using npm or yarn. Run the following command:

```sh
npx sb init
```
    
    This command will detect your project type and install the necessary dependencies for Storybook.

2. **Update Storybook Configuration**: After installing, you need to configure Storybook to work with your Vite setup. Create or update the `.storybook/main.js` file with the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-links',
    '@storybook/addon-essentials',
  ],
  framework: '@storybook/react',
  core: {
    builder: 'storybook-builder-vite',
  },
};
```

3. Install Vite Builder: Since you're using Vite, you need to install the Vite builder for Storybook. Run the following command:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @storybook/builder-vite
```

4. **Add Vite Configuration**: Create a vite.config.js file if you don't have one already, and make sure it exports your Vite configuration. Storybook will use this configuration:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

5. Run Storybook: Now you can start Storybook with the following command:

```
npm run storybook
```
   
## Deploy a Storybook

To deploy a Storybook instance for a Vite React project using `storybook-deployer`, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Install Storybook and Deployer**

First, make sure you have Storybook installed in your Vite React project. If not, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
npx storybook init
```

Then, install storybook-deployer:

```bash
npm install --save-dev storybook-deployer
```
  
2. **Configure Storybook**

Ensure your Storybook is configured correctly. The configuration files are typically located in a `.storybook` directory in your project's root. The main configuration file is usually `main.js`

3.  **Add Deployment Script**

Add a deploy script to your `package.json` file. This script will use `storybook-deployer` to deploy your Storybook instance to GitHub Pages.

```json
"scripts": {
  "build-storybook": "storybook build",
  "deploy-storybook": "storybook-to-ghpages"
}
```

4. **Configure Storybook Deployer (not necessarily)**

Create a `storybook-deployer` configuration file in your project's root directory. This file can be named `storybook-deployer.js`. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  branch: 'gh-pages',
  message: 'Deploy Storybook',
  remote: 'origin'
};
```

Adjust the `branch`, `message`, and `remote` according to your needs.

5.  Build and Deploy

Run the following commands to build and deploy your Storybook instance:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
npm run deploy-storybook
```

The `build-storybook` command will build your Storybook instance, and the `deploy-storybook` command will deploy it to the specified branch on GitHub Pages.

6. **Access Your Deployed Storybook**

After deployment, you can access your Storybook instance via the GitHub Pages URL, which is typically:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
```

**Additional Notes**

- Ensure your GitHub repository has the `gh-pages` branch created, or the deployer will create it for you.
- You might need to configure your repository settings on GitHub to enable GitHub Pages and set the source to the `gh-pages` branch.

By following these steps, you should be able to deploy your Vite React project's Storybook instance using `storybook-deployer` successfully. If you encounter any issues, please provide specific error messages or logs for further assistance.
